    <ol>
        <li>There was no doctype so I added one</li>
        <li>The heading didn't have a closing tag so I added a closing tag</li>
        <li>The paragraph didn't have an opening tag so I added an opening tag</li>
        <li>The list had mismatched tags so I switched the closing tag to ol</li>
        <li>The paragraph had no closing tag so I added a closing tag</li>

        <li>The image had no alt attribute so I added one</li>
        <li>The link had an img closing tag so I changed it to a link closing tag</li>
        <li>The table didn't have a closing tag so I added a closing table tag</li>
        <li>The image used the word source instead of src so I changed it to src</li>
        <li>The text was centered using center which is no longer supported so I changed it to a paragraph with the text-align attribute</li>
        <li>The text with a light grey background used the wrong attribute and didn't use style="" in the opening tag so I added the style part and switched the attribute</li>

        <li>There was an unclosed comment so in order to fix it I added "-->"</li>
        <li>There was a link without a closing tag so I added closing link tag</li>
        <li>For the underlined text em was used instead of u and the closing tags were swapped so I changed the em to a u tag and moved the closing u tag before the closing p tag</li>
        <li>In the description list li tags were used for both the title and the text so I switched the title to a dt tag and the text to a dd tag</li>
    </ol>
